# Big Data Using Python Coursework
## Welcome to my Big Data Portfolio

Above is coursework I completed as a graduate student at Villanova University.
In this course we explored several big data topics and their applications.

#### Python Tutorials
Two basic python tutorials exploring the python dictionaries and explaing the difference between lists and tuples.

#### Pandas & Numpy
Getting aquainted with both Pandas and Numpy while practicing using them for managing and manipulating data.
Also performing an in depth analysis of all sidewalks within Washington DC.

#### MatplotLib
Exploring the functionality of MatPlotLib and experimenting with the various types of graphs it offers.

#### MapReduce
Learning about map reduction using a large collection of test data.

#### Link Analysis
Performing link analysis on ParadoxPlaza.com utilizing scrapy for websrcaping and HIITS for the analysis.

#### CLustering
Performing clustering analysis on NHL game statistics from the past several years.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
Using Dimensionality reduction to try to find emergent trends in crypto Data

#### Domain Paper and Presentation
Halfway through the semester, I began my investigation into the big data domain of stock and crypto markets.
The paper and presentation are a writeup of my preliminary findings that layed the groundwork for my final project.

#### Final Project: Stock Prediction using Machine Learning
For my final project I spent a lot of time learning about machine learning with tensorflow.
I used tensorflow to build basic econonmic models and tranined them using S&P500 data from the past 5 years. 
I built several models in different configurations all with varying results.
I then used knowledged learned from the entirety of this course to perform trend analysis and improve my model.
While this project is by no means a successful creation of a stock prediction model, it was a successful learning experience that
taught me a lot about neural networks and practical applications of big data.

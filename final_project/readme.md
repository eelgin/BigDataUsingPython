# Run order  
This project was created in a pipenv in python 3.7. The 4 librays needed are pandas-datareader, tensorflow, sklearn, and matplotlib.
  
To run all of the the Neural Networks, just use the run all scipt.
To run a single neural network simulation run the neural network python script within the /nn/ folder from the final project directory.
  
Once all the neural networks have been run, running stats_analyze.py will create several graphical representations of the results.
